# About Me

### Charles Ting
Born on December 22, 1999 and attended Troy High School before deciding to major in Computer Science at UCSD.
**Since my dream is to be a programmer, I take my studies very seriously. I wish to learn all I can about the sofware development and be the best version of myself.**

### Inspiration
As Kobe Bryant once said:

> Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise. 

**My mother and father are also inspirations. They emigrated from Taiwan to America to find a better life**

### Journey
From being barely able to understand `System.out.println("Hello World");`, I now work on projects ranging from machine learning to app development.

### Miscellaneous Info
I spend my free time playing video games with my friends, watching anime, or just hanging out and grabbing food (pre-covid). I also watch professional e-sports and all sorts of professional sports (basketball, football, and baseball).
